Hello!
This project is an amalgamation of the concepts we learned in Data 144 at UC Berkeley, otherwise called Data Mining and Analytics. In this project, we employed the use of several different machine learning models in order to 
accurately predict a song's popularity based off of specific features. We used Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Random Forests, Clustering, and Word2Vec in this project and this resulted in a ~66% F-1 score average.
